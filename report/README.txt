README for the `tools' bundle
=============================

This `bundle' consists of LaTeX2e packages written and supported by
members of the LaTeX3 Project Team.

The documented source code of each package is in a file with extension
`.dtx'.  Running LaTeX on the file tools.ins will produce all the
package files, and some associated files.

So you should first process tools.ins:

  latex tools.ins

The files with extensions `.sty' and `.tex' (including a file whose
name is just `.tex') should then be moved to a directory on LaTeX's
standard input path.

See the Note at the end of this file if you have problems processing
the tools.ins file.

Documentation for the individual packages may then be obtained by
running LaTeX on the `.dtx' files.

For example:

  latex array.dtx

will produce the file array.dvi, documenting the array package.


The file manifest.txt contains a list of the main files in the
distribution together with a one-or-two line summary of each package.


Copyright
=========
Copyright is maintained on each of these packages by the author(s)
of the package.
